// The bind method in JavaScript is a method provided by all functions that creates a new function with a specific this
// value and possibly some arguments already provided. This is often used to ensure that a function has the correct this
// value.

// // In your code, this.handleClick.bind(this) is creating a new function where this inside handleClick is the react
// instance.

// // Here's what's happening:

// // When new react() is called, a new react object is created and this inside the react constructor is set to this new
// object.

// // document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this)) is then called. This adds
a
// click event listener to the button.

// // this.handleClick.bind(this) creates a new function where this inside handleClick is the react instance. This
ensures
// that when the button is clicked and handleClick is called, this inside handleClick is the react instance, not the
// button.

// // So, when the button is clicked, console.log('button clicked') and console.log(this.server) are called with this
set
// to the react instance. This means this.server will correctly log 'https://localhost:3000'.

// // Without bind, this inside handleClick would be the button, because event handlers in JavaScript are called with
this
// set to the target of the event. This would mean this.server would be undefined, because the button doesn't have a
server
// property.
